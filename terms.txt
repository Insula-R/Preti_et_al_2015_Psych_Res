### "Reproducibility is defined as the ability to recompute data analytic results, given an observed data set 
### and knowledge of the data analysis pipeline".

### "The replicability of a study is related to the chance that an independent experiment targeting the 
### same scientific question will produce a result consistent with the original study".

### Reproducibility favors the endeavor of replicability, but it is indpendent from it.
### Essentially, being able to reproduce the results of the analyses of a study
### allows you to clearly understand its implications. 
### However, you may decide to replicate a study by using other models to analyse your data.

### "There are two major components to a reproducible study: 
### that the raw data from the experiment are available; 
### and that the statistical code 
### and documentation to reproduce the analysis are also available".

### DOI: 10.1111/j.1740-9713.2015.00827.x.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### For this reasons, we have decided to make available the raw data 
### and the statistical code used to perform the analyses described in the paper.
### The documentation to reproduce the analysis is also available.

### The codes and the data are provided as free software, under the terms 
### of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, 
### either version 3 of the License, or any later version.

### In using this material, you are expected to follow these rules:

### 1. If you use the data for purposes that respond to the same or related aims of the study to which they belong
###    (in this case, the determination of the factor structure of the SPQ),
###    you are expected to involve the principal investigator of the study as co-author
###    and to share with him/her your analyses and conclusions.

### 2. If you use the data for purposes that respond to different aims of those of the study
###    (e.g., to test a statistical model of your own creation),
###    you are expected to cite the article related to the data you are using
###    ad as well cite the repository from which you downloaded the data.
###    There is no need you inform the principal investigator of the study,
###    or involve him/her as co-author.

### 3. If during the reanalysis of the data you find an error in the codes, 
###    or claim some mistake was done in the analysis of the data, 
###    you are expected to inform the principal investigator of the study.
###    If you decide to publish a paper on the claimed error or mistake,
###    you are expected to inform the principal investigator of the study,
###    but you are not obliged to involve him/her as co-author
###    (indeed, it would be awkward for him/her to share the co-authorship
###    of an article that is contrary to his/her own study's conclusions).
###    However, you are expected to cite the article related to the data you are using
###    ad as well cite the repository from which you downloaded the data.
###    Moreover, since you are using publicly available data and codes,
###    you are expected to provide all set of codes you used to make your claim,
###    so independent researchers could evaluate the correctness of your analyses.

### 4. If you use the codes for your own analysis of data that are fitted for this purpose
###    you are expected to cite the article related to the data you are using
###    and as well to cite the repository from which you downloaded the data.
###    There is no need you inform the principal investigator of the study,
###    or involve him/her as co-author.

### 5. If you use some section of the codes (e.g., a particular solution for plotting some data),
###    there is no need you inform the principal investigator of the study,
###    or involve him/her as co-author. Also, you are not obliged to cite
###    the article related to the codes you are using
###    or to cite the repository from which you downloaded the codes.
###    However, as a courtesy to the author(s), you may cite 
###    the repository from which you downloaded the codes.
